## Key Features

### 1. **Automated Seat Reservation System**
- Students can register for a seat, and the reservation is valid for **one month**.
- After one month, the seat is automatically marked as **available** for new reservations.

### 2. **Voice Assistant Integration**
The system includes a **voice-controlled AI assistant** that enhances user experience by executing commands via speech recognition. The assistant can:
- **Open specific pages**: "Open registration page", "Show student records", "Open reports".
- **Check seat availability**: "Check available seats".
- **Control external applications**:
  - "Open Chrome"
  - "Search book images on Chrome"
  - "Google search <query>"

### 3. **WhatsApp Notification for Seat Availability**
- The system automatically sends a **WhatsApp notification** to students when a seat becomes available.

### 4. **User-Friendly Graphical Interface (JFrame-based UI)**
- Well-structured, **intuitive interface** for easy navigation.
- Interactive buttons for manual control, with a **dedicated mic activation button**.
- The voice assistant only executes actions when a command is given, ensuring **accuracy and security**.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Java (Swing/JFrame for GUI)
- **AI & Voice Recognition:** Speech Recognition for executing commands
- **Messaging API:** WhatsApp API for notifications
- **Database:** MySQL (or any other RDBMS) for managing student records and seat reservations

## Future Enhancements
- Expanding AI capabilities for **more advanced voice commands**.
- **Mobile app version** for seamless access.
- Integration of **RFID-based book tracking**.

This project demonstrates expertise in **AI integration, automation, and software development**, making it a great addition to  software development and AI-based projects.
